## üéØ The Problem

Counterfeit medicines pose a significant and life-threatening risk to global health. It is incredibly challenging for pharmacies, hospitals, and consumers to reliably verify the authenticity of drugs. Existing systems are often manual or centralized, making them vulnerable to errors, manipulation, and security breaches. There is a critical need for a transparent, secure, and decentralized solution.

## üí° Our Solution

**Medi-Verify** is a decentralized application that provides a transparent and immutable ledger for pharmaceutical supply chains, built on the Internet Computer (ICP). By scanning a product's unique identifier (emulated via QR code, barcode, or RFID), the system cross-references it with a secure on-chain canister to instantly verify its authenticity, trace its journey, and confirm critical details like:

* **Manufacturer Name**
* **Batch Number**
* **Manufacturing & Expiry Date**
* **Unique Blockchain Hash**

This process ensures that every stakeholder‚Äîfrom the manufacturer to the end consumer‚Äîcan trust the legitimacy of the medicine, enhancing patient safety and building confidence in the pharmaceutical ecosystem.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The Medi-Verify ecosystem operates in a clear, sequential flow that ensures integrity at every step of the supply chain.

### 1. Manufacturer Registration
* **Action:** A pharmaceutical manufacturer registers a new batch of medicine through the dedicated portal.
* **Process:** Product details (name, batch number, expiry date) are submitted.
* **Outcome:** A new, immutable record is created in the ICP canister, generating a unique QR code/ID for the batch.

### 2. Supply Chain Transfer
* **Action:** The manufacturer sells or transfers the medicine batch to a registered seller (distributor/pharmacy).
* **Process:** The ownership transfer is recorded on the blockchain, updating the product's journey.
* **Outcome:** The transaction is logged, providing a transparent and auditable trail of custody.

### 3. Consumer Verification
* **Action:** A consumer, pharmacist, or hospital scans the QR code on the medicine package using the Medi-Verify dashboard.
* **Process:** The application queries the ICP canister using the unique product ID.
* **Outcome:** The dashboard displays the full, verified history of the product. If the details match the on-chain record, it is marked as **"Authentic."** If not, it is flagged, preventing a potential counterfeit from being used.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üë• Role-Based Access:** Separate, intuitive interfaces for Manufacturers, Sellers, and Consumers.
* **üîó Immutable On-Chain Ledger:** All medicine data is stored in `StableBTreeMap` within an ICP canister, ensuring data persistence and tamper-proof records.
* **üöö End-to-End Tracking:** The entire journey of a medicine package is tracked and visible on the blockchain.
* **‚úÖ Instant Verification:** Consumers can easily scan a product's code to view its complete history and confirm its authenticity in real-time.
* **üìã Transaction History & Reporting:** All verification activities are logged, ensuring accountability and providing data for audits.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm
* DFINITY Canister SDK (`dfx`)

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Pranav-Marwaha-73/Medi_Verify_Counterfeit-Drug-Detection.git](https://github.com/Pranav-Marwaha-73/Medi_Verify_Counterfeit-Drug-Detection.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
